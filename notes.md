        - ~~dijkstra~~
    - priority queue
    - catch edge cases, for example:
        - there is no path to the end
- implement decision making
    - how do we pick a path when there are multiple same length paths
- print out shortest path

## extra credit

- figure out how to use cmake on windows
- add C linter
- add testing framework (googletest?)
- add github actions to automate testing on linux and windows
- add memory leak testing capabilites
    - how to implement with cmake?
        - may not need cmake if we just use a fsanitize=address compile flag

## questions

- what is C?
